<h1>Career</h1>


<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Dhoni began his career in 1998 by playing for Bihar U-19 team. He also played for East Zone U-19 team. In 1999-2000, he made a debut for Bihar in Ranji Trophy. His brilliant performances in the Deodhar Trophy, Duleep Trophy and India ‘A’ tour of Kenya, brought him to the notice of the national team selectors. He was then selected to play for the Indian Cricket team in 2004, where he made his ODI debut against Bangladesh in Chittagong.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Since then, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has come a long way in cricket. His sterling performances with the bat have rescued India from many a tight position. In his illustrious career, Dhoni has played 90 Tests scoring 4876 runs with his highest being 224 against Australia at Chennai in 2013. His amazing statistics behind the stumps include 256 catches and 38 stumpings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;In the ODI scenario, Dhoni has so far played 265 matches scoring 8620 runs, with his highest being a staggering 183 not-out against Sri Lanka, in Jaipur, 2005-06. His ODI wicket-keeping statistics include 246 catches and 85 stumpings. Dhoni made his ICC Cricket World Cup debut in 2007 and played only three matches due to India’s early exit. India won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, among others, under his captainship.</p>

<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;He is also the captain of the Chennai Super Kings Team in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Under his captaincy, the team has won two IPL titles and also the Champions League Twenty20 in 2010.</p>

<h2><li>Retirement</li></h2>
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Dhoni announced his retirement from International Test Cricket on 30 December 2014 following the drawn test between India and Australia in Melbourne. The reason that he cited behind his immediate retirement was the strain of playing cricket in all the formats of the game and to concentrate better on ODIs and T-20 matches. However, on 04 January 2017, he stepped down from the position of captain of the Indian ODI and T20I cricket teams, though reportedly he informed the board about his availability for selection for the upcoming series against England.
